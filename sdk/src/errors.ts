/**
 * Thrown when a caller supplies `validUntil === 0` to an operation digest or
 * signature encoder.
 *
 * The ERC-4337 EntryPoint packs `validUntil` into the returned `validationData`
 * and reads a packed value of `0` as "no expiry" rather than as a timestamp.
 * `GlauxAccount.validateUserOp` already refuses to validate a user operation whose
 * signed `validUntil` is `0` (`decoded && validUntil != 0 && ...`), so a client
 * that built such a signature anyway would only discover it is unusable after a
 * round trip through a bundler. Failing at build time is strictly earlier.
 *
 * Zero is unusable on every Glaux operation path: direct execution reverts it
 * as expired, ERC-4337 returns signature-validation failure, and ERC-1271
 * returns its invalid sentinel. Rejecting it while building prevents clients
 * from producing a signature the contract cannot use.
